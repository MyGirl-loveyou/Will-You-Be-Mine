                <pre class="speech">
Dear Clara
HEY BABE

Isn't that how people start letters these days &#128514 So it's been a long time since we thought about each other romantically &#128556 but I miss the good old days.
We've come far and I find myself questioning how this is possible, perhaps we are God's chosen ones &#128514 but to be serious, I think it's great that we've been "together" for such a long time.
I find it cool that we are friends and thinking about taking the next step (well now you know where this is going &#128521). We've dated before, we've been friends before, heck we even tried being brother and sister &#128514 but what that proves is how we aren't willing to let go of each other.
I think back to the old days in high school when we used to hug, write homework together, kiss, sit at the dining tables together, walk in the field and send each other letters. All these moments I have with you are so joyful and are etched in my memory. 
I miss you a lot, I haven't been able to touch you in a while. I do miss touching sexually &#128527 and non-sexually. Holding your hand is something I miss more than grabbing your bunda. (not to say your bunda wasn't lovely to grab &#127825&#128527)
Do you remember the big letter you wrote for me when I had to leave early for Zambia cause of lockdown, I look at that and it was the peak of our relationship, I could comfortably say I was in love back then &#128514<!--laugh--> I can only hope that you felt the same way.
I've run out of romantic shit to say but I'm sure you've heard it all by now. I thought about you before you wrote your exams, and I just couldn't wait for you to finish them even though you hadn't started. I had missed talking to my companion... you &#128153
It got pretty lonely without you, I misbehaved a couple of times, but you never left my mind and I'm happy we're back to talking, even though we are fighting more than talking #&128514<!--laugh--> almost like a married couple.
When we stopped talking I thought that my feelings for you decipated and began to worry &#128517 but then I was put to ease by some words that came to me, they made me realise that my feelings for you could never fade. I don't know if you stopped liking me... <iframe width="240" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qVSftoi9zfU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
I was watching a romance anime, the main reason why I started liking these romance animes is because our romance was cut short. So I preferred to live vicariously through the characters in the show. I wish that one day we could do it again, be kids and have fun together. Just the two of us doing what we love doing.
I wondered how things would be when you got back. If we would start dating? would we be happy? But I don't know how things will go, would the prospect of dating even change how we act? I would be able to call you babe though &#128514&#128521 
I was in bed one day and I was building my perfect girlfriend from my exes &#128514 weird right. I concluded that the you got the most important part of all, if I was going to date a girl, I would want them to have your personality. 
Remember the time you told me that you don't want to be on a call with me cause you're shy. Well that meant a lot to me, and I found that very attractive. I want to explore your shyness and innocense with you. It'll probably take some time but one day we'll be on a video call late at night talking about our lives together or you'll be stripping for me &#128521</pre>

                <p>Well Clara, I like you. I also want to be with you...</p>
                <p>I like your character, your smile, your face, your body, your mind and everything about you... So will you be my girlfriend?</p>

                <h1 class="title">The End</h1>
                <div class="end">
                <p>I hope you enjoyed all of that... Even though I asked you to be my girlfriend, I don't think we can date.</p> 
                <p>We are long distanced, which is sad. You'll need physical attention and the same goes for me. Once you start school, assuming you go to a mixed, there will be a plethora of boys falling at your feet. I don't want to deny you that experience by having that loyalty commitment hanging over your head. I tried it and failed within a term &#128514 but you'll have to do it for 2 years.</p>
                <p>I don't mind dating online but knowing myself, I have some online sexual needs that I know you cannot provide, so it will just be torture for the both of us. So it's best we just remain friends... But when I say friends, I don't mean it, we are more than that. There is a life out there in which we get married, and that sounds like a good life.</p>
                <p>Things might change in the next 2 years and we may not see each other the same way, but I can only speak on the now... And I want a future with you.</p>
                <p>So what do you say? Look, we would've gone on a spree of cheating on each other &#128514<!--laugh--> but like this, there's no pressure. When you go back to school I will just play with my girl-toys until mommy gets back. No one can replace you, but I'm not sure you can say the same about me.</p>
                <p>This is one of my sex songs but it still suits the occassion and is actually very nice, hope you like it.</p>
